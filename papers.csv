Rather, all of these results follow from very weak properties of the Fourier transform (shared by numerous linear operators), namely that it is bounded as an operator $L^1 \to L^\infty$, and that it is unitary. Using a single, simple proof template, and only these (or weaker) properties, we obtain some new proofs and many generalizations of these basic uncertainty principles, to new operators and to new settings, in a completely unified way. This paper can also serve as a survey of the many facets of the uncertainty principle.",

Correspondingly, in the infrared limit, these systems behave effectively as Weyl fermions in $3+1$ dimensions. We consider a class of interacting 3D lattice models for Weyl semimetals and prove that the quadratic response of the quasi-particle flow between the Weyl nodes is universal, that is, independent of the interaction strength and form. Universality is the counterpart of the Adler-Bardeen non-renormalization property of the chiral anomaly for the infrared emergent description, which is proved here in the presence of a lattice and at a non-perturbative level. Our proof relies on constructive bounds for the Euclidean ground state correlations combined with lattice Ward Identities, and it is valid arbitrarily close to the critical point where the Weyl points merge and the relativistic description breaks down.",

To illustrate these theoretical results, we present a tutorial application of the method to a problem from Bayesian statistics.",

First, a set of numerical values for some low-pt correlation functions is guessed. The large $N$ loop equations are then used to generate values of higher-pt correlation functions based on this guess. Then one tests whether these higher-pt functions are consistent with positivity requirements, e.g., $\langle \text{tr }M^{2k} \rangle \ge 0$. If not, the guessed values are systematically ruled out. In this way, one can constrain the correlation functions of random matrices to a tiny subregion which contains (and perhaps converges to) the true solution. This approach is tested on single and multi-matrix models and handily reproduces known solutions. It also produces strong results for multi-matrix models which are not believed to be solvable. A tantalizing possibility is that this method could be used to search for new critical points, or string worldsheet theories.",

This method allows us to provide explicit bounds for the Dirichlet norm of the extensions. It runs as follows: by inverting the trace operator, we first determine suitable extensions, not necessarily solenoidal, of the data; then we analyze the Bogovskii problem with the resulting divergence to obtain a solenoidal extension; finally, by solving a variational problem involving the infinity-Laplacian and using ad hoc cutoff functions, we find explicit bounds in terms of the geometric parameters of the obstacle. The natural applications of our results lie in the analysis of inflow-outflow problems, in which an explicit bound on the inflow velocity is needed to estimate the threshold for uniqueness in the stationary Navier-Stokes equations and, in case of symmetry, the stability of the obstacle immersed in the fluid flow.",

Such a system is modeled by a stochastic differential equation with non-vanishing Brownian noise, and is restricted in a domain with absorbing boundary. Instead of minimizing the Onsager-Machlup action functional, we examine the maximum probability that the solution process of the system stays in a neighborhood (or a tube) of a transition path, in order to characterize the most probable transition path. We first establish the exponential decay lower bound and a power law decay upper bound for the maximum of this probability. Based on these estimates, we further derive the lower and upper bounds for the most probable transition time, under suitable conditions. Finally, we illustrate our results in simple stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the relation with some relevant works.",

Such coupled simulations allow the application of the elastic model to geological regions that are of special interest for seismic exploration studies (e.g., the areas surrounding salt bodies), while with the computationally more tractable acoustic model still being applied in the background regions. Specifically, the acoustic wave system is expressed in terms of velocity and pressure while the elastic wave system is expressed in terms of velocity and stress. Both systems are posed in first-order forms and discretized on staggered grids. Special variants of the standard finite-difference operators, namely, operators that possess the summation-by-parts property, are used for the approximation of spatial derivatives. Penalty terms, which are also referred to as the simultaneous approximation terms, are designed to weakly impose the elastic-acoustic interface conditions in the finite-difference discretizations and couple the elastic and acoustic wave simulations together. With the presented mechanism, we are able to perform the coupled elastic-acoustic wave simulations stably and accurately. Moreover, it is shown that the energy-conserving property in the continuous systems can be preserved in the discretization with carefully designed penalty terms.",
