,,Supersymmetric D-term Twin Higgs,Marcin Badziak,Keisuke Harigaya,"We propose a new type of supersymmetric Twin Higgs model where the SU(4) invariant quartic term is provided by a D-term potential of a new U(1) gauge symmetry. In the model the 125 GeV Higgs mass can be obtained for stop masses below 1 TeV, and a tuning required to obtain the correct electroweak scale can be as low as 20 %. A stop mass of about 2 TeV is also possible with tuning of order O(10) %.

By including a quantum kinetic equation combined with full counting statistics, we investigate the steady state energy flux and noise power. The influence of the nonlinear Bose-Hubbard interaction on the transfer behaviors is analyzed, and the nonmonotonic features are clearly exhibited. Particularly, in the strong on-site repulsion limit, the results become identical with the nonequilibrium spin-boson model. We also extend the quantum kinetic equation to study the geometric-phase-induced energy pump. An interesting reversal behavior is unraveled by enhancing the Bose-Hubbard repulsion strength.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00206

Nevertheless, it has not been proven in all generality and has in certain scenarios even been shown to fail, depending on the boundary profiles of the terminated system. Here, we introduce bulk numbers that capture the exact number of in-gap modes, without any such subtleties in one spatial dimension. Similarly, based on these 1D bulk numbers, we define a new 2D winding number, which we call the pole winding number, that specifies the number of robust metallic surface bands in the gap as well as their topological character. The underlying general methodology relies on a simple continuous extrapolation from the bulk to the boundary, while tracking the evolution of Green's function's poles in the vicinity of the bulk band edges. As a main result we find that all the obtained numbers can be applied to the known insulating phases in a unified manner regardless of the specific symmetries. Additionally, from a computational point of view, these numbers can be effectively evaluated without any gauge fixing problems. In particular, we directly apply our bulk-boundary correspondence construction to various systems, including 1D examples without a traditional bulk-boundary correspondence, and predict the existence of boundary modes on various experimentally studied graphene edges, such as open boundaries and grain boundaries. Finally, we sketch the 3D generalization of the pole winding number by in the context of topological insulators.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01466

Intrinsic magnetoelastic coupling in chiral magnets permits manipulation of magnetic skyrmions and their lattice using mechanical loads, which is essential for developing future spintronics devices. It is found in experiments that the stability and deformation of skyrmions are sensitive to stresses, while the appearance of magnetic skyrmions in turn has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the underlying material. However, a theory which explains these related phenomena within a unified framework is not seen. Here we construct a thermodynamic model for B20 helimagnets incorporating a magnetoelastic functional with necessary higher order interactions derived by group theory. Within the model, we establish the methodology to calculate the phase diagram and equilibrium properties of helimagnets under coupled temperature-magneto-elastic field. Applying the model to bulk MnSi, we calculate the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram under stress-free condition and its variation when uniaxial compression is applied. We also calculate the variation of all the elastic constants with magnetic field. The results obtained agree quantitatively with corresponding experiments. Our model provides a reliable basis for further theoretical studies concerning any magnetoelastic related phenomena in chiral magnets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02766

To study possible deviations from the Hawking's prediction, the dispersive field theory models have been proposed, following the Unruh's hydrodynamic analogue of a black hole radiation. In the dispersive field theory models, the dispersion relations of matter fields are modified at high energies, which leads to modifications of equations of motion. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to investigate the dispersive field theory models. The preferred frame is the static frame of the black hole. The dispersion relation adopted agrees with the relativistic one at low energies but is modified near the Planck mass $m_{p}$. We calculate the corrections to the Hawking temperature for massive and charged particles to $\mathcal{O}\left(m_{p}^{-2}\right) $ and massless and neutral particles to all orders. Our results suggest that the thermal spectrum of radiations near horizon is robust, e.g. corrections to the Hawking temperature are suppressed by $m_{p}$. After the spectrum of radiations near the horizon is obtained, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of a massless scalar field near the horizon of a 4D spherically symmetric black hole. We find that the leading term of the entropy depends on how the dispersion relations of matter fields are modified, while the subleading logarithmic term does not. Finally, the luminosities of black holes are computed by using the geometric optics approximation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03045
,,Single-mode instability in standing-wave lasers: The quantum cascade laser as a self-pumped parametric oscillator,Tobias S. Mansuripur,Federico Capasso,"We report the observation of a clear single-mode instability threshold in continuous-wave Fabry-Perot quantum cascade lasers (QCLs).

The instability is characterized by the appearance of sidebands separated by tens of free spectral ranges (FSR) from the first lasing mode, at a pump current not much higher than the lasing threshold. As the current is increased, higher-order sidebands appear that preserve the initial spacing, and the spectra are suggestive of harmonically phase-locked waveforms. We present a theory of the instability that applies to all homogeneously broadened standing-wave lasers. The low instability threshold and the large sideband spacing can be explained by the combination of an unclamped, incoherent Lorentzian gain due to the population grating, and a coherent parametric gain caused by temporal population pulsations that changes the spectral gain line shape. The parametric term suppresses the gain of sidebands whose separation is much smaller than the reciprocal gain recovery time, while enhancing the gain of more distant sidebands. The large gain recovery frequency of the QCL compared to the FSR is essential to observe this parametric effect, which is responsible for the multiple-FSR sideband separation. We predict that by tuning the strength of the incoherent gain contribution, for example by engineering the modal overlap factors and the carrier diffusion, both amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated emission can be achieved from QCLs. We provide initial evidence of an AM waveform emitted by a QCL with highly asymmetric facet reflectivities, thereby opening a promising route to ultrashort pulse generation in the mid-infrared. Together, the experiments and theory clarify a deep connection between parametric oscillation in optically pumped microresonators and the single-mode instability of lasers, tying together literature from the last 60 years.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00187

Systematic methods are presented to encode quantum information topologically using gapped boundaries, and to perform topologically protected operations on this encoding. In particular, we introduce a new and general computational primitive of topological charge measurement and present a symmetry-protected implementation of this primitive. Throughout the Letter, a concrete physical example, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code ($\mathfrak{D}(\mathbb{Z}_3)$), is discussed. For this example, we have a qutrit encoding and an abstract universal gate set. Physically, gapped boundaries of $\mathfrak{D}(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ can be realized in bilayer fractional quantum Hall $1/3$ systems. If a practical implementation is found for the required topological charge measurement, these boundaries will give rise to a direct physical realization of a universal quantum computer based on a purely abelian topological phase.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05490

The index of determinacy quantifies the stability of uniqueness of solutions of the moment problem. We give results on the constancy of this index in terms of perturbations of the corresponding Jacobi operators. The permanence of the $N$-extremality of a measure is also studied. A measure $μ$ is $N$-extremal when the polynomials are dense in $L_2(\mathbb{R},μ)$. As a by-product, we give a characterization of the index in terms of cyclic vectors. We consider a new inverse problem for Jacobi operators in which information on the place where the interior perturbation occurs is obtained from the index of determinacy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01699

We have also performed calculations of several properties that are relevant for assessing the reliability of the calculations of the amplitudes of the above mentioned transitions. We highlight the importance of correlation effects by giving the results of both the Dirac-Fock (DF) and RCC contributions. Approximate contributions to these properties from the Breit and quantum electrodynamics (QED) interactions have also been evaluated. Plausible experimental schemes to measure these transition amplitudes by light shift techniques and interference involving induced Stark shifts are outlined.,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04340

The infinite-dimensional symmetries are shown to arise when one is restricted to boundary subspaces with effectively two-dimensional geometry. A canonical example of such a restriction occurs within the 4D subregion described by a Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctional of AdS$_4$ quantum gravity. An AdS$_4$ analog of Minkowski ""super-rotation"" asymptotic symmetry is probed by 3D Einstein gravity, yielding CFT$_2$ structure, via AdS$_3$ foliation of AdS$_4$ and the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The maximal asymptotic symmetry is however probed by 3D conformal gravity. Both 3D gravities have Chern-Simons formulation, manifesting their topological character. Chern-Simons structure is also shown to be emergent in the Poincare patch of AdS$_4$, as soft/boundary limits of 4D gauge theory, rather than ""put in by hand"", with a finite effective Chern-Simons level. Several of the considerations of asymptotic symmetry structure are found to be simpler for AdS$_4$ than for Mink$_4$, such as non-zero 4D particle masses, 4D non-perturbative ""hard"" effects, and consistency with unitarity. The last of these, in particular, is greatly simplified, because in some set-ups the time dimension is explicitly shared by each level of description: Lorentzian AdS$_4$, CFT$_3$ and CFT$_2$. The CFT$_2$ structure clarifies the sense in which the infinite asymptotic charges constitute a useful form of ""hair"" for black holes and other complex 4D states. An AdS$_4$ (holographic) ""shadow"" analog of Minkowski ""memory"" effects is derived. Lessons from AdS$_4$ provide hints for better understanding Minkowski asymptotic symmetries, the 3D structure of its soft limits, and Minkowski holography.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09080

A key advantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature and hence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other cosmological probes. However, if the Lyman-$α$ forest transmission is sensitive to the initial streaming velocity of the baryons relative to the dark matter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted. Here we investigate this sensitivity using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of small regions of the intergalactic medium with a range of box sizes and physics assumptions; each simulation starts from initial conditions at the kinematic decoupling era (z~1059), undergoes a discrete change from neutral gas to ionized gas thermal evolution at reionization (z~8), and is finally processed into a Lyman-$α$ forest transmitted flux cube. Streaming velocities suppress small-scale structure, leading to less violent relaxation after reionization. The changes in the gas distribution and temperature-density relation at low redshift are more subtle, due to the convergent temperature evolution in the ionized phase. The change in the BAO scale is estimated to be of the order of 0.12% at z=2.5; some of the major uncertainties and avenues for future improvement are discussed. The predicted streaming velocity shift would be a subdominant but not negligible effect (of order $0.26σ$) for the upcoming DESI Lyman-$α$ forest survey, and exceeds the cosmic variance floor. It is hoped that this study will motivate additional theoretical work on the magnitude of the BAO shift, both in the Lyman-$α$ forest and in other tracers of large-scale structure.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03358

We describe how the quantum effective actions summarizing these effects can be computed efficiently for Weyl-flat metrics by integrating the Weyl anomaly or, equivalently, the local renormalization group equation. This method relies only on the local Schwinger-DeWitt expansion of the heat kernel and allows for a re-summation of leading large logarithms in situations where the Weyl factor changes by several e-foldings. As an illustration, we obtain the quantum effective action for the Yang-Mills field coupled to massless matter, and the self-interacting massless scalar field. Our action reduces to the nonlocal action obtained using the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky covariant perturbation theory in the regime $R^{2} \ll \nabla^{2} R $ for a typical curvature scale $R$, but has a greater range of validity effectively re-summing the covariant perturbation theory to all orders in curvatures. In particular, it is applicable also in the opposite regime $R^{2} \gg \nabla^{2} R$, which is often of interest in cosmology.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00135

This also permits to predict and analyse the near-recurrences, thereby inferring the universal character of the mechanism originally discovered for the Korteweg-deVries equation.

ADL can be identified by use of the sensors available in many off-the-shelf mobile devices, including magnetic and motion, and the environment can be also identified using acoustic sensors. The study presented in this paper is divided in two parts: firstly, we discuss the recognition of the environment using acoustic sensors (i.e., microphone), and secondly, we fuse this information with motion and magnetic sensors (i.e., motion and magnetic sensors) for the recognition of standing activities of daily living. The recognition of the environments and the ADL are performed using pattern recognition techniques, in order to develop a system that includes data acquisition, data processing, data fusion, and artificial intelligence methods. The artificial intelligence methods explored in this study are composed by different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), comparing the different types of ANN and selecting the best methods to implement in the different stages of the system developed. Conclusions point to the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with normalized data for the identification of ADL with 85.89% of accuracy, the use of Feedforward neural networks with non-normalized data for the identification of the environments with 86.50% of accuracy, and the use of DNN with normalized data for the identification of standing activities with 100% of accuracy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00124

Several models of transcription factor-DNA binding which consider DNA shape have been developed in recent years. We present a new biophysical model of protein-DNA interaction by considering the DNA shape features, which is based on a neighbour dinucleotide dependency model BayesPI2. The parameters of the new model are restricted to a subspace spanned by the 2-mer DNA shape features, which allowing a biophysical interpretation of the new parameters as position-dependent preferences towards certain values of the features. Using the new model, we explore the variation of DNA shape preferences in several transcription factors across cancer cell lines and cellular conditions. We find evidence of DNA shape variations at FOXA1 binding sites in MCF7 cells after treatment with steroids. The new model is useful for elucidating finer details of transcription factor-DNA interaction. It may be used to improve the prediction of cancer mutation effects in the future.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10547

We show that the fluorescence enhancement due to the coupling between optical emitter and sphere can be tuned by the aspect ratio of the core-shell nanosphere and by the distance between the quantum emitter and its surface. In particular, we demonstrate that both the enhancement and quenching of the fluorescence intensity are associated with plasmonic Fano resonances induced by near- and far-field interactions. These Fano resonances have asymmetry parameters whose signs depend on the orientation of the dipole with respect to the spherical nanoshell. We also show that if the atomic dipole is oriented tangentially to the nanoshell, the interaction exhibits saddle points in the near-field energy flow. This results in a Lorentzian fluorescence enhancement response in the near field and a Fano line-shape in the far field. The signatures of this interaction may have interesting applications for sensing the presence and the orientation of optical emitters in close proximity to plasmonic nanoshells.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04856

In particular, we discuss the simplest composite quantum body - a hydrogen atom - and define its gravitational masses operators. Using Gedanken experiment, we show that the famous Einstein's equation, $E =mc^2$, is broken with small probability for passive gravitational mass of the atom. It is important that the expectation values of both active and passive gravitational masses satisfy the above mentioned equation for stationary quantum states. Nevertheless, we stress that, for quantum superpositions of stationary states in a hydrogen atom, where the expectation values of energy are constant, the expectation values of the masses oscillate in time and, thus, break the Einstein's equation. We briefly discuss experimental possibility to observe the above-mentioned time-dependent oscillations.

Mixers are ubiquitous components in modern radio-frequency technology and are widely used in microwave signal processing. The development of versatile frequency mixers for optical frequencies remains challenging: such devices generally rely on weak nonlinear optical processes and, thus, must satisfy phase matching conditions. In this work, we utilize a GaAs-based dielectric metasurface to demonstrate an optical frequency mixer that concurrently generates eleven new frequencies spanning the ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR) spectral range. Our approach combines strong intrinsic material nonlinearities, enhanced electromagnetic fields, and relaxed phase-matching requirements, to allow seven different nonlinear optical processes to occur simultaneously. Specifically, when pumped by two femtosecond NIR pulses, we observe second-, third- and fourth-harmonic generation, sum-frequency generation, two-photon absorption induced photoluminescence, four-wave mixing, and six-wave mixing.

The simplest neutral confinement model is analyzed for hard spheres where there is no change of the equilibrium pair structure upon particle pinning. As the pinned fraction grows, cage scale dynamical constraints are intensified in a manner that increases with density. This results in the mobile particles becoming more transiently localized, with increases of the jump distance, cage scale barrier and NLE theory mean hopping time; subtle changes of the dynamic shear modulus are predicted. The results are contrasted with recent simulations. Similarities in relaxation behavior are identified in the dynamic precursor regime, including a roughly exponential, or weakly supra-exponential, growth of the alpha time with pinning fraction and a reduction of dynamic fragility. However, the increase of the alpha time with pinning predicted by the local NLE theory is too small, and severely so at very high volume fractions. The strong deviations are argued to be due to the longer range collective elasticity aspect of the problem which is expected to be modified by random pinning in a complex manner. A qualitative physical scenario is offered for how the three distinct aspects that quantify the elastic barrier may change with pinning. ECNLE theory calculations of the alpha time are then presented based on the simplest effective-medium-like treatment for how random pinning modifies the elastic barrier. The results appear to be consistent with most, but not all, trends seen in recent simulations. Key open problems are discussed with regards to both theory and simulation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00086

In prior work, we proposed an algorithm called Deep Discovery of Options (DDO) to discover options to accelerate reinforcement learning in Atari games. This paper studies an extension to robot imitation learning, called Discovery of Deep Continuous Options (DDCO), where low-level continuous control skills parametrized by deep neural networks are learned from demonstrations. We extend DDO with: (1) a hybrid categorical-continuous distribution model to parametrize high-level policies that can invoke discrete options as well continuous control actions, and (2) a cross-validation method that relaxes DDO's requirement that users specify the number of options to be discovered. We evaluate DDCO in simulation of a 3-link robot in the vertical plane pushing a block with friction and gravity, and in two physical experiments on the da Vinci surgical robot, needle insertion where a needle is grasped and inserted into a silicone tissue phantom, and needle bin picking where needles and pins are grasped from a pile and categorized into bins. In the 3-link arm simulation, results suggest that DDCO can take 3x fewer demonstrations to achieve the same reward compared to a baseline imitation learning approach. In the needle insertion task, DDCO was successful 8/10 times compared to the next most accurate imitation learning baseline 6/10.

The two bias voltages in the circuits are the control variables of the studied system while the electrochemical potentials at the device's terminals are non-trivially dependent on the voltages. For the special case of the linear-response regime analytical formulae for the operation of the coupled quantum-classical device are derived and applied. For higher bias voltages numerical solutions are obtained. The effects of non-equilibrium Fermi levels are captured using a recursive algorithm in which self-consistency between the electrochemical potentials and the currents is reached within few iterations.

Predictive control of QCD would allow nuclear structure and reactions as well as properties of supernovae and neutron stars to be theoretically studied from first principles. Lattice QCD can represent generic QCD predictions in terms of well-defined path integrals, but the sign and signal-to-noise problems have obstructed lattice QCD calculations of large nuclei and nuclear matter in practice. This thesis presents a statistical study of lattice QCD correlation functions, with a particular focus on characterizing the structure of the noise associated with quantum fluctuations. The signal-to-noise problem in baryon correlation functions is demonstrated to arise from a sign problem associated with Monte Carlo sampling of complex correlation functions. The phases of complex correlation functions are analyzed in the framework of circular statistics, and the time evolution of the phase is shown to resemble a heavy-tailed random walk on the unit circle. Building on these observations, a new technique called phase reweighting is investigated that involves calculations of phase differences over fixed-length time intervals. Phase reweighting allows results for hadronic observables to be extracted from large-time correlation functions with constant signal-to-noise ratios. The signal-to-noise problem re-emerges as the length of the phase-difference interval is increased. Applications of phase reweighting to meson, baryon, and two-baryon systems are discussed.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00062

Not only because it may allow the agent to cope with large amounts of data, but also because in some environments, an agent with no generalization capabilities cannot learn. In this work we outline several criteria for generalization, and present a dynamic and autonomous machinery that enables projective simulation agents to meaningfully generalize. Projective simulation, a novel, physical approach to artificial intelligence, was recently shown to perform well in standard reinforcement learning problems, with applications in advanced robotics as well as quantum experiments. Both the basic projective simulation model and the presented generalization machinery are based on very simple principles. This allows us to provide a full analytical analysis of the agent's performance and to illustrate the benefit the agent gains by generalizing. Specifically, we show that already in basic (but extreme) environments, learning without generalization may be impossible, and demonstrate how the presented generalization machinery enables the projective simulation agent to learn.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02247

These constraints are incompletely explored, but have stringent restrictions on a magnetic geometry. This work employs an analytic approach to understand the implications of the constraints. The particles move in an intrinsically three dimensional equilibrium whose representation is given by earlier work of Weitzner and its extension here. For deeply trapped particles a local equilibrium expansion around a minimum of the magnetic field strength along a magnetic line suffices. This analytical non-symmetric equilibrium solution, enables explicit representation of the constraints. The results show that it is far easier to satisfy the omnigeneity condition than the quasisymmetry requirement. Correspondingly, there exists a large class of equilibrium close to quasisymmetry that remain omnigeneous while allowing inclusion of error fields, which may destroy quasisymmetry.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00059
,,A Theoretical Solution of the Mind-Body Problem: An Operationalized Proof that no Purely Physical System Can Exhibit all the Properties of Human Consciousness,Catherine Reason,Catherine Reason,"…humans to ""know"" with certainty that they are conscious.

We identify a specific operation which is a necessary property of all healthy human conscious individuals -- specifically the operation of self-certainty, or the capacity of healthy conscious humans to ""know"" with certainty that they are conscious. This operation is shown to be inconsistent with the properties possible in any meaningful definition of a physical system. This inconsistency is demonstrated by proving a ""no-go"" theorem for any physical system capable of human logical reasoning, if this reasoning is required to be both sound and consistent. The proof of this theorem is both general -- it applies to any function whereby evidence affects the state of some physical system -- and recursive, since any physical process subserving a function of this type is shown to imply another such function. Thus for at least one aspect of human consciousness, the mind-body problem is now conclusively resolved.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04192

In this work, we classify all possible decay modes of the supersymmetric heavy Higgs boson using the SModelS framework. We work within the phenomenological MSSM and use the ATLAS pMSSM study as our viable parameter space. We find that for a bino-like and higgsino-like LSP, a significant region of the parameter space results in mono-$X$ ($X$ = $h$, $W$, $Z$) final states. For wino-like LSPs, we demonstrate the existence of displaced vertex signatures with a large signal cross section. Finally, we argue that by covering the mono-$X$ final states, a large part of heavy Higgs decays can be tested at the LHC.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00056

From the consideration of Aharonov-Bohm interaction of electrons and magnetic field, the ground state of a half-filled lowest Landau level is mathematically transformed to a Fermi sea of composite objects of electrons bound to two flux quanta, termed composite fermions (CFs). A strong support for the CF theories comes from experimental confirmation of the predicted Fermi surface at $ν$ = 1/2 (where $ν$ is the Landau level filling factor) from the detection of the Fermi wave vector in the semi-classical geometrical resonance experiments. Recent developments in the theory of CFs have led to a prediction of a $π$ Berry phase for the CF circling around the Fermi surface at half-filling. In this paper we provide the first experimental evidence for the detection of the Berry phase of CFs in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Our measurements of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of CFs as a function carrier density at a fixed magnetic field provide a strong support for an existence of a $π$ Berry phase at $ν$ = 1/2. We also discover that the conductivity of composite fermions at $ν$ = 1/2 displays an anomalous linear density dependence, whose origin remains mysterious yet tantalizing.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07307
